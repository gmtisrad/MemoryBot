      Defendant and Counter-Plaintiff Marlowe Navarro, an officer of the Rowe
      Police Department ("Navarro"), brings this Counter-Complaint against
      Plaintiff and Counter-Defendant Jersey Jackson ("Jackson"), seeking
      damages and other relief due to the frivolous claim of retaliation filed
      against Navarro.
    </p>
    <h2>Parties</h2>
    <p>
      1. Navarro is an individual employed as a police officer by the Rowe
      Police Department (RPD) and a resident of Rowe, Oregon. At all material
      times herein, Navarro was acting within the course and scope of their
      employment with RPD.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Jackson is an individual who resides in Rowe, Oregon. Jackson has filed
      a complaint alleging retaliatory arrest against Navarro.
    </p>
    <h2>Statement of Facts</h2>
    <p>
      3. Jackson, a journalist employed by The Rowegonian, attended a public
      demonstration on January 15, 2020, and was subsequently arrested by
      Navarro due to noncompliance with lawful orders to disperse.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Jackson alleges that Navarro acted unlawfully and retaliated against
      them for exercising their First Amendment rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Navarro contends that Jackson's arrest was lawful and based on
      Jackson's refusal to follow lawful orders.

    <h2>Claims for Relief</h2>
    <h3>First Claim for Relief: Frivolous Lawsuit</h3>
