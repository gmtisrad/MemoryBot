  <p> Defendant Marlowe Navarro, by and through his attorneys, hereby moves this Court to dismiss the complaint filed by
    Plaintiff Jersey Jackson in the above-captioned case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). </p>
  <p> In the alternative, Navarro also alleges that he is protected by qualified immunity and that Plaintiff's claims
    should be dismissed on that basis. The qualified immunity doctrine protects government officials from being held
    liable for civil damages unless the official violated a clearly established constitutional right. Smith v.
    Cumberland, 587 U.S. 350, 355 (2017). </p>
  <p> In this case, the affidavits of Camden Buchanan, Stevie Smith, Jesse Saab, Jersey Jackson, Marlowe Novarro, and
    the police department's crowd control policy provide the basis for the qualified immunity argument. Navarro's
    actions were not in violation of any clearly established constitutional right and were taken in accordance with the
    police department's policy. </p>
  <p> For these reasons, Defendant Marlowe Navarro respectfully requests that this Court dismiss Plaintiff Jersey
    Jackson's complaint with prejudice. </p>
