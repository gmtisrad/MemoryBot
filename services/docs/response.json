JURISDICTION AND VENUE  2. This Court has jurisdiction over Jackson’s claims by virtue of 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343, i.e.,  because this case involves a violation of Jackson’s federal civil and constitutional rights.  3. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, i.e., because the events giving rise to  Jackson’s claims against Navarro occurred in the judicial district in which this Court is situated.  III. PARTIES  4. Jackson is an individual who resides in Rowe, Oregon.  5. Navarro is an individual employed as a police officer by RPD and a resident of Rowe, Oregon.  At all material times herein, Navarro was acting within the course and scope of Navarro’s employment with  RPD.  IV. FACTS  6. Jackson is a journalist employed by The Rowegonian.  7. On December 20, 2019, Jackson attended a public demonstration at the Digby Theater in  downtown Rowe. The demonstration concerned the Rowe City Council’s decision authorizing the theater owner  to demolish the building, which is an historic landmark. Jackson attended the demonstration because Jackson  had recently written a story about the theater’s demolition and was continuing to report on the matter.  8. At the demonstration, Jackson approached a protester named “Danger” Smith, who appeared  willing to provide a quote to Jackson about the reasons for the demonstration.  9. Navarro was on duty for RPD at the demonstration. A few seconds after Jackson began speaking  with Smith, Navarro approached them and threatened to arrest Smith.  10. As far as Jackson was aware, Smith was doing nothing illegal. Jackson said as"},{"score":0.34579166769981384,"id":"441953592120826232","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826232","document_chunk_original":"  CLASSROOM LAW PROJECT                       2020 – 2021 Oregon High School Mock Trial Competition                       www.classroomlaw.org  12  14. Smith was again participating in the demonstration. Shortly after the demonstration began,  Jackson heard Smith yell: “Let’s barricade ourselves in! They can’t knock it down if we’re inside!” Smith then  grabbed a rock from the ground and started to move toward the Digby’s front door, which is made of stained  glass. It looked to Jackson like Danger was going to smash the window. Jackson ran over to Smith, yelled  “Stop!” and grabbed the rock out of Smith hand. At no point during the January 15th demonstration did Jackson  do anything illegal.  15. A moment after Jackson grabbed the rock from Smith, Navarro tackled Jackson and arrested  Jackson. Navarro knew that Jackson was doing nothing wrong, but Navarro arrested Jackson anyway. As  Navarro tackled Jackson, Navarro said: “You again, huh? And I expect you’ll say you were doing nothing  illegal either?”  16. Jackson was released within a few hours. The Chinook County District Attorney’s Office  charged Jackson with disorderly conduct but dropped the charges shortly afterward.  V. CLAIM FOR RELIEF  42 U.S.C. § 1983—Retaliatory Arrest in Violation of First Amendment  17. Jackson incorporates and realleges each of the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  18.

Plaintiff Jersey Jackson (“Jackson”) brings this action against Marlowe Navarro (“Navarro”) for  violating Jackson’s clearly established constitutional rights. On January 15, 2020, Navarro, an officer of the  Rowe Police Department (“RPD”), wrongfully arrested Jackson during a demonstration in downtown Rowe.  Navarro did so in violation of Jackson’s Fourth Amendment rights and in retaliation for Jackson’s protected  exercise of Jackson’s First Amendment rights. Jackson seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages, and  other relief.  ///  ///  ///       CLASSROOM LAW PROJECT                       2020 – 2021 Oregon High School Mock Trial Competition                       www.classroomlaw."},{"score":0.36009806394577026,"id":"441953592120826236","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826236","document_chunk_original":"         2020 – 2021 Oregon High School Mock Trial Competition                       www.classroomlaw.org  17  UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT    DISTRICT OF OREGON    ROWE DIVISION    JERSEY JACKSON, an individual,    Plaintiff,              v.

The Rowe Police Department had the lawful authority to order the dispersal of the  individuals at the Digby Theater on January 15, 2020, and to arrest those individuals who refused  to disperse following two (2) clear verbal warnings.  2. The parties each have conducted reasonable searches and, save for Exhibit 3, have  located no pertinent audio or video of the events that occurred at the Digby Theater on December  20th, 2019 and January 15, 2020.  3. Navarro is not entitled to qualified immunity on any of Jackson’s claims.  4. During testimony, no witness will be entitled to assert any right against self- incrimination, whether arising under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution,  Article I, Section 1, Clause 12 of the Oregon Constitution, or otherwise.  5. The first phase of the trial shall deal with Navarro’s potential liability only. If  necessary, a determination as to damages and any other relief to which Jackson may be entitled  will be made in a separate proceeding.  6. All exhibits included in the following case materials are authentic. All signatures  on witness affidavits and other documents are authentic.

Case No. 3:20-cv-00101-CC    FINAL JURY INSTRUCTIONS        The Court will now submit the case to the jury; you need to decide, based on the law and the evidence  presented to you at trial, whether the plaintiff has prevailed in proving the plaintiff’s claims against each  defendant.  PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE  The Plaintiff must prove all of the Plaintiff’s claims by a “preponderance of the evidence.” That means  that the Plaintiff must persuade you by evidence that makes you believe that Plaintiff’s claims are more likely  true than not true. After weighing all of the evidence, if you cannot decide that something is more likely true  than not true, you must conclude that the plaintiff did not prove it. You should consider all of the evidence in  making that determination, no matter who produced it.  RETALIATORY ARREST IN VIOLATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT  Under the First Amendment, a citizen has the right to free expression. In order to prove the defendant  deprived the plaintiff of this First Amendment right, the plaintiff must prove the following elements by a  preponderance of the evidence: (1) the"},{"score":0.37631556391716003,"id":"441953592120826291","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826291","document_chunk_original":"�ve testified as an expert witness seven times in civil trials involving 29  allegations of police misconduct; in six of those cases, I testified for the defense, and in the other, I testified 30  for the plaintiff. The only caveat to all that, I suppose, is that I’ve never actually worked as a police officer 31  myself.  Still,  though,  since  I’ve  been  thinking,  writing,  and  teaching  about  best  practices  for  police 32       CLASSROOM LAW PROJECT                       2020 – 2021 Oregon High School Mock Trial Competition                       www.classroomlaw.org  52  departments for the better part of three decades, I’m confident that my views on the subject are reliable and 1  well-grounded in fact. 2   I became involved in this case when Jersey Jackson filed a complaint with the CRC regarding Jersey’s 3  arrest  by  Marlowe  Navarro.  Jersey’s  basic  complaint  was  that  Officer  Navarro  had  arrested  Jersey  in 4  retaliation for Jersey’s exercise of Jersey’s First Amendment rights. Right away, we let Jersey know that we 5  couldn’t come to a conclusion one  way  or  the  other  on  that  specific issue; we’re not  lawyers,  and  more 6  importantly, we really aren’t able to determine what was going on in Officer Navarro’s head at the time of 7  the arrest. (For that reason, I can’t give an opinion one way or the other on whether Jersey’s prior comments 8  to Officer Navarro  had  anything  to  do  with  the  subsequent  arrest.)  Still,  the  CRC  is  there  to  serve  the 9  community,  so  we  agreed  to  investigate  the  arrest  in  a  more  general  sense,  with  the  goal  of  determining 10  whether there was anything improper or irregular about it. 11   In conducting our investigation, I personally interviewed Jersey, Officer Navarro, Danger"},{"score":0.38208791613578796,"id":"441953592120826260","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826260","document_chunk_original":" for sure whether Officer Navarro recognized Jersey. Also, because Jersey 6  was no more than 30 or 40 feet away from me, it’s possible that Officer Navarro was really headed toward 7  me, but I just can’t be sure. Exhibit 4 is a true and accurate representation of Officer Navarro’s location 8  before Officer Navarro started heading toward me and Jersey. At  the  same  time,  three  or  four  other 9  protesters  who  had  been  on  the  line  with us apparently had decided that an arrest wasn’t worth  it  and 10  started walking away from the theater. Officer Navarro walked right by them without saying a word.   11   At the same time, it was beginning to dawn on me that our protest in its current state wasn’t going 12  to save the Digby. I decided that we had no choice but to up the ante. In hindsight, this was a really dumb 13  idea, but I thought we’d stand a better chance of deterring the bulldozers if there were real, live human 14  beings inside the theater, and I yelled as much to the crowd. (That sort of thing worked for the Free Speech 15  Movement at Berkeley the ‘60s, after all, right?) I knew I’d have to find a way to get inside the theater, 16  though, so I picked up a rock and turned toward the Digby’s front door, which is made of stained glass. 17  Better to break a window, I thought at the time, than to destroy the entire building. 18   As  I  was  turning,  I  felt  a  hand  on  my  wrist.  It was Jersey. “Danger, stop!” Jersey pleaded, and 19  grabbed the rock out of my hand. I turned back toward Jersey, such that I was facing away from the theater 20  and Jersey was facing toward it. I remember the next part clearly. “Danger,” Jersey began to say, “I’m 21  sorry, but breaking into the theater is a terrible —” Then, all of a sudden, Officer Navarro appeared behind 22  Jersey, grabbed Jersey’s hand, and forced Jersey to the ground. Jersey let out a surprised yell but didn’t 23  resist. �"},{"score":0.38642778992652893,"id":"441953592120826287","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826287","document_chunk_original":"  It took  me a  second  to 27  figure out where the voice was coming from, but I then noticed someone in a blue t-shirt standing in front 28  of the fence by the Digby’s front door with what looked like a brick in the person’s hand. I started to yell: 29  “Hey! That person is  about to break down the door!” There was a beat, and then, fortunately, a police 30  officer grabbed the person by the wrist and appeared to arrest the person. 31   The  police  officer,  whom  I  now  know  and  recognize  as Marlowe  Navarro,  walked  the  person, 32  whom I now know and recognize as Jersey Jackson (I had never met or seen Jersey’s face before), right 33       CLASSROOM LAW PROJECT                       2020 – 2021 Oregon High School Mock Trial Competition                       www.classroomlaw.org  49  by  the  place  where  I  was  standing.

By 4  that point, only two or three of them were still there, and Officer Navarro’s colleagues seemed to be trying 5  to pry them away from the fence. Officer Navarro started walking back toward the fence, but by the time 6  Officer Navarro got there, all of the protesters had either left or had been arrested. 7   The whole episode was pretty stressful.

This  time,  Officer  Navarro 31  looked annoyed. Officer Navarro slapped Officer Navarro’s hand down on Jersey’s shoulder, and, looking 32  at me, said, “I hope I don’t have to arrest you again, Danger.

Just go away!” Officer Navarro seemed taken aback at first, but then Officer 3  Navarro  collected  themselves and responded: “Look, you’re blocking traffic, you’re blocking these 4  bulldozers, and now you’re interfering with my job as a police officer.

I 12  arrested Jersey solely because I thought Jersey was about to throw a rock through the Digby’s window, 13  and not for any other reason.

Navarro was on duty for RPD at the demonstration. A few seconds after Jackson began speaking  with Smith, Navarro approached them and threatened to arrest Smith.  10. As far as Jackson was aware, Smith was doing nothing illegal. Jackson said as much to Navarro,  in response to which Navarro became angry. Navarro turned toward Jackson and yelled: “You’re blocking  traffic, you’re blocking these bulldozers, and now you’re interfering with my job as police officer!” Navarro  then threatened to arrest Jackson as well. Like Smith, Jackson was doing nothing illegal.  11.  A few moments later, word came down that the Rowe City Council had decided to postpone its  authorization of the demolition; due to Jackson’s reporting, the City had decided to investigate a number of  irregularities in the inspection that had led it to authorize the theater owner’s plans.  12. Several weeks later, the Rowe City Council issued another decision criticizing the original  inspection but reaffirming its approval of the demolition.  13. The City’s decision sparked another public demonstration, which occurred outside the Digby  Theater on January 15, 2020. Again, because Jackson was continuing to report for The Rowegonian on the  matter, Jackson attended the demonstration.

The other protesters and I linked arms, formed a line between the bulldozers and the 12  Digby, and began chanting.

Jersey caught my eye, and 14  I beckoned Jersey with a nod and a smile.

When we refused 24  to move, Officer Navarro arrested me. “C’mon,” I complained as Officer Navarro was handcuffing me, 25  “why do you have to be such a buzzkill?” I thought that might annoy Officer Navarro, but Officer Navarro 26  was actually very nice about the whole thing, and chuckled when I said the word “buzzkill.” I remember 27  Officer Navarro telling me politely"},{"score":0.42209362983703613,"id":"441953592120826300","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826300","document_chunk_original":"IT 3: Audio Recording from January 15, 2020      This audio recording was made on January 15, 2020 by Camden Buchanan.

Before we get into the meat of my 3  story, let’s start with some background. I’m 31 years old, and I was born right here in Rowe. I’ve lived 4  here all my life. I went to college at Rowe State University, where I earned a B.A. in journalism in 2012. 5  I’ve worked as a reporter for The Rowegonian for the last year and a half or so. 6  I’ve been obsessed with journalism for basically my whole adult life. During my freshman year of 7  high  school,  I  read All the President’s Men,  which  totally  mesmerized  me. (The  movie  was  almost  as 8  good, although I couldn’t quite get past the terrible ‘70s fashion ) Isn’t it incredible to think that a reporter 9  can  change  the  course  of  history  with  nothing  more  than  a  pen,  paper,  and  a  dogged  commitment  to 10  uncovering  the  truth?  Right  then  and  there,  I  decided  to  follow  Woodward  and Bernstein’s example. I 11  would become a professional muckraker, exposing corruption and injustice wherever I found it.   12   My first few years in journalism were pretty lean; for a reporter, at least, journalism isn’t exactly 13  what I’d call a “lucrative” business. To me, though, that didn’t matter. I loved what I did, and, most of the 14  time, I felt like I was really making a difference. I started my career at What’s Up Rowe? — a weekly 15  publication that, in fairness, you might call a “rag” — writing about whatever scandals I happened to dig 16  up. My biggest stories during that time included an exposé on how a group of students at Burrough High 17  School drugged their rival school’s star basketball player before a big tournament; an investigation into 18 "},{"score":0.4504430592060089,"id":"441953592120826257","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826257","document_chunk_original":" face. “What in the world 1  are you doing!” screamed Jersey, who then was about an inch away from Officer Navarro’s nose. “Danger 2  isn’t doing anything illegal! Just go away!” Officer Navarro seemed taken aback at first, but then Officer 3  Navarro  collected  themselves and responded: “Look, you’re blocking traffic, you’re blocking these 4  bulldozers, and now you’re interfering with my job as a police officer. Clear out now before I arrest you!” 5  Officer Navarro  seemed  really  irritated,  but  Officer  Navarro  didn’t raise Officer Navarro’s voice. A 6  moment or two after that, the bulldozers powered down, in response to which the other protesters and I let 7  out a wild cheer. Our protest had saved the Digby! At that point, both Officer Navarro and Jersey walked 8  away, and that was the end of the whole thing. 9   Or so I thought. In early January 2020, I read on social media that the Digby’s owner was trying 10  again to demolish it, and that the City Council had okayed it. That made me furious! Fortunately, I also 11  learned  via  social  media  that  another  protest  had  been  scheduled  for January  15,  2020  in  front  of  the 12  Digby, the day when the demolition was supposed to take place. Obviously, I had to be there. It seemed 13  like it’d just be a repeat of the last one, hopefully with the same result. 14  Was I ever wrong! When I arrived at the Digby on the 15th, things were already tenser than they 15  had been the last time. I got there at about 9:30 a.m., at which point a dozen or so protesters had positioned 16  themselves  in  a  line  against  the  chain-link fence  surrounding  the  Digby.  Naturally,  I  joined them.  In 17  retrospect, I can’t say I’m proud of this, but, following the other protesters’ lead, I started taunting the 18  police officers.

As Jersey was approaching my spot on the line, though, I noticed a familiar face. 3  Officer  Navarro  was  walking  briskly  from  the  lot  with  the  bulldozers  toward  Jersey.  Officer  Navarro 4  wasn’t running, but  Officer Navarro also wasn’t taking Officer Navarro’s time. Jersey’s back was to 5  Officer Navarro, so I don’t know for sure whether Officer Navarro recognized Jersey. Also, because Jersey 6  was no more than 30 or 40 feet away from me, it’s possible that Officer Navarro was really headed toward 7  me, but I just can’t be sure.

I had only ever been to the Digby to see the Grateful Dead a few times in the 31  ‘80s, but I know that the theater has an even broader and more important place in Rowe’s civic history 32  and culture. “Well, what are we waiting for?” I asked Jersey. “Let’s head down there and give the theater 33  owner a piece of our minds!” Jersey told me that there was talk on social media of an organized protest 34       CLASSROOM LAW PROJECT             "},{"score":0.4619828462600708,"id":"441953592120826288","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826288","document_chunk_original":" back toward the remaining protesters.

I don’t remember exactly 24  what I said next, but I reminded Danger that Danger was blocking traffic and asked Danger to move. 25   Those words had barely left my mouth when Jersey spun around and started yelling at me. Again, 26  I don’t remember exactly what Jersey said, but it was something about how I had no right to arrest Danger 27  because Danger wasn’t doing anything wrong. I tried at first to explain that I wasn’t going to arrest Danger 28  unless Danger refused to move, but Jersey wouldn’t let me get a word in edgewise. It seemed, then, that I 29  would have to be a little sterner. “Look,” I said steadily, “you’re blocking traffic, you’re blocking these 30  bulldozers, and now you’re interfering with my job as a police officer. Clear out, or we’re going to have 31  to start making arrests.” That seemed to do the trick; Jersey and Danger began walking back toward the 32  sidewalk. A moment later, the bulldozers powered down.

Danger seemed to be backing 1  away from the line of protesters, and it soon became clear why. I heard Danger yell through the crowd: 2  “Let’s barricade ourselves in! They can’t knock it down if we’re inside!” What I saw next horrified me. 3  Danger picked up a rock from the ground and turned toward the Digby’s immense front door, which is 4  made of vintage stained glass. It looked to me like Danger was going to throw the rock over the fence and 5  smash the window, so I ran over to Danger — I was yelling “Stop!” as I ran — and grabbed the rock out 6  of Danger’s hand. A true and correct image of that rock is shown in Exhibit 1. I was facing the Digby’s 7  front door, but I was turned very slightly to the left, such that the door was slightly to my right. I recall 8  that I had the rock in my right hand as I was talking to Danger. 9  I started saying something to Danger (I don’t remember what), but a second or two later, someone 10  grabbed me from behind and forced me to the ground. I heard a familiar voice: “You again, huh? And I 11  expect you’ll say you were doing nothing illegal either?” It was Officer Navarro, who arrested me and 12  hauled me off to Rowe Police’s headquarters.

Still,  the  CRC  is  there  to  serve  the 9  community,  so  we  agreed  to  investigate  the  arrest  in  a  more  general  sense,  with  the  goal  of  determining 10  whether there was anything improper or irregular about it. 11   In conducting our investigation, I personally interviewed Jersey, Officer Navarro, Danger Smith, and 12  Camden Buchanan. During those interviews, they informed me of the facts that appear in their affidavits in 13  this case, and nothing more. In my opinion, those interviews provided me with sufficient information for my 14  analysis.

First, 17  since about the 1980s, it’s become clearer and clearer as a statistical matter that community-based policing 18  leads  to  better  overall  results. “Community-based policing” is a loose term, but it refers generally to an 19  approach  to  policing  in  which  officers  hold  themselves  out  as  partners  with  the  communities  they  serve. 20  They’re there not simply to  arrest  people  who  commit  crimes,  but  rather to  take  a proactive approach  to 21  solving problems. To put that in concrete (if overly simplistic) terms, a good police officer doesn’t just sit 22  and wait on a street corner hoping to catch a litterer in the act; instead, she ensures that the public waste bins 23  on  the  corner  remain  clean  and  unobstructed.  And,  if  the  officer  happens  to  catch  someone  littering,  the 24  officer might simply engage the person in polite conversation and ask her to pick up her trash, rather than 25  issuing her a full-blown ticket. 26   Second, however, context matters quite a bit when"},{"score":0.47851279377937317,"id":"441953592120826247","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826247","document_chunk_original":" was right in Danger’s face. “Officer,” I asked, “what in the world are you doing? That person isn’t doing 27  anything illegal at all! You can’t arrest this person!” In an attempt to try to cool things down, I tried to 28  position myself between Officer Navarro and Danger, but Officer Navarro spun around and started yelling 29  at me. “You’re blocking traffic, you’re blocking these bulldozers, and now you’re interfering with my job 30  as a police officer,” Officer Navarro yelled at me. “Clear out now before I arrest you!” 31  I backed away, startled.

Never before 3  had any of my journalism produced such an important and tangible impact.  4  My elation, it turned out, was short-lived.

Following  the  explosion, the Digby’s  owner,  Camden 21  Buchanan, had decided to demolish the theater and replace it with a newer, shinier building. There was 22  just one problem: the Digby had been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1991. For 23  that reason, Jett explained, Oregon law required Rowe’s City Council to determine that the Digby was 24  structurally unsound before it could approve of Camden’s plan. It had done so a few days ago, Jett told 25  me, based on a report presented by a building inspector named Ari Frankel. There was something fishy 26  about Ari’s report, and Jett suggested I should follow up on it. (Jett didn’t want to touch the story herself 27  — something about being “too close to the action,” as she put it — so she gave me the lead instead.) 28  I dug in immediately. And, after what seemed like an endless review of old newspaper clippings, 29  public records, and court filings, I finally figured it out: Ari was a de facto employee of Camden, and had 30  been for some time.

The name’s Camden Buchanan. I’m 54 years old, and I’m the founder and chief executive 3  officer  of  Buchanan  Properties  LLC.  Our company’s mission  is  simple:  we  buy  decrepit  buildings, 4  renovate  them  while  keeping their  basic charms  and  style  intact, and  then  either lease  them  out  or  sell 5  them. Sure, it’s business, and I do pretty well for myself, but I like to think I’m also making a difference, 6  you know? We give new leases on life (so to speak) to structures that most people have long forgotten, 7  and I like to think that Rowe’s skyline is better for it.  8   The Digby Theater, which we acquired in 2012, is one of our finest properties, but it’s also turned 9  out to be one of the trickiest to manage. The theater has been around since the 1920s, and, in my opinion, 10  it’s the single most gorgeous building in Rowe. I’ve never seen stained glass as beautiful or as intricate as 11  that in the windows on the theater’s enormous front doors."},{"score":0.48766404390335083,"id":"441953592120826276","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826276","document_chunk_original":"  about  0900  hours  that morning,  an  hour  before  the 4  demolition was scheduled to begin. By about 0915, a number of what we guessed were protesters began 5  arriving and were milling around on the sidewalk. Then, at 1000 hours, when the demolition crew began 6  turning out the construction equipment, the protesters marched into the street, linked arms, and formed a 7  line between the equipment and the theater. It was basically what Camden had warned us about, and while 8  it required a police response — traffic had started to back up behind the protesters — it wasn’t anything 9  major. Along with a couple of my colleagues, I approached the line of protestors and planned on asking 10  them  to move  out  of  the  street.  When  I  got  closer,  though,  I  recognized  one  of  the  protesters:  Danger 11  Smith.  I arrested Danger a  couple  of  years  ago  at  a  protest in  the  Topaz  neighborhood,  and  I  had  seen 12  Danger a couple of other times since then, both at protests and at the Freedom Cup coffeehouse. To be 13  honest, I like Danger — Danger is kind of a ‘60s radical, and is usually pretty fun to talk to — so, figuring 14  I’d be able to communicate best with a protester I already knew, I decided to start by asking Danger to 15  move out of the street. 16  When I got close to Danger, a person I didn’t recognize darted between us. I now know that person 17  to be Jersey Jackson. At first, I was startled, but then I realized that Jersey was asking Danger for what 18  sounded like a journalistic comment. That was fine, but Jersey, Danger, and the other protesters were still 19  blocking traffic. To get Jersey’s attention, I put my hand on Jersey’s shoulder. I did so gently, in the way 20  you would interact with a friend.

Both in the online comments 1  to Jersey’s story and on social media, I started seeing calls for a protest at the Digby. I didn’t think much 2  of it at the time, but, just to be safe, I called the Rowe Police Department and asked that they send a couple 3  of officers to the scene to make sure things proceeded in an orderly fashion. I didn’t attend the renovation 4  myself, though. (I had an appointment that day out in Cascade County.) 5   The morning of when the renovations were supposed to begin — December 20, 2020, I recall — 6  I received a call from my office manager Erin Esparza, who told me that, in light of Jersey’s article, the 7  City Council had decided to suspend its authorization of our project. I was flabbergasted! How could the 8  City pull the rug out from under our feet just because of one measly article? It was absolutely ridiculous. 9  Fortunately,  we  were  able  to  smooth  things  over  with  the  City;  we  hired  a  second  inspector  who, 10  unsurprisingly, confirmed Ari’s findings. I then worked with our contractors to reschedule the renovations 11  for January 15, 2020, and this time, I made sure to be there in person. I wanted to be 100% certain that 12  everything went off without a hitch. Like I did the last time, I called the Rowe Police Department and 13  asked that they send some officers to make sure things didn’t get out of hand with any protesters. 14  Right away, though, I knew we were going to have a problem.

Most of them, unfortunately, seemed to ignore me.  19  As I got toward the end of the line, though, one protester beckoned for me to come nearer. That 20  protester was “Danger” Smith, whom I know as a barista at Rowe’s “Freedom Cup” coffee shop (which I 21  visit regularly). Smith began speaking into my phone, but before I could make out what Smith was saying, 22  I felt a hand slam down on my shoulder. I heard a stern voice from behind me. “Don’t make me arrest 23  you, Danger,” the voice said. “Just clear out of the street right now and we won’t have a problem.” As 24  soon as I heard the voice, I spun around to find myself staring at a police officer whom I now recognize 25  as Marlowe Navarro.

None of that is to say I won’t continue to push the 7  journalistic envelope, but since then I’ve been a lot more careful when I do. 8  I was excited beyond words when The Rowegonian agreed to hire me in early 2019. Obviously, 9  The Rowegonian is Rowe’s flagship newspaper. It’s been around for about a century, and it’s broken all 10  of Rowe’s biggest stories during that time. I mean, what journalist wouldn’t want to work there? I had 11  submitted three or four prior applications to The Rowegonian over the years, and, each time, they told me 12  to check back when I had more experience. Finally, in early 2019, they decided to “take a chance” on me, 13  to use my editor’s exact words. I knew this was my opportunity to prove myself and I wasn’t going to let 14  my editor down. 15  For  the  rest  of  2019,  things  were  pretty  slow,  and  I was getting  more  and  more  worried.  What 16  would Jessica Gallagher (my editor) think if I couldn’t dig up something juicy by the end of the year? 17  Fortunately, in December 2019, I caught a break. My friend and fellow journalist Jett Jones gave me a 18  scoop  about the fate  of  the  Digby  Theater,  which  just  a  few  months  earlier  had  been  the  scene  of  an 19  unspeakable tragedy. There had been an explosion, Jett reminded me, and a young music fan had been 20  trampled  to  death  in  the  ensuing  stampede.  Following  the  explosion, the Digby’s  owner,  Camden 21  Buchanan, had decided to demolish the theater and replace it with a newer, shinier building. There was 22  just one problem: the Digby had been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1991. For 23  that reason, Jett explained, Oregon law required Rowe’s City Council to determine that the Digby was 24  structurally unsound before"},{"score":0.5221850275993347,"id":"441953592120826268","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826268","document_chunk_original":"  were  present  here, I’m able to come to a reliable 9  conclusion about how easy it would’ve been for an average human being in Officer Navarro’s position to 10  hear Danger’s comment. As I suggested above, from where Officer Navarro was standing, the sound of 11  the bulldozer would’ve been louder than a busy subway station but not quite as loud as a jackhammer. At 12  the  same  time,  the  sound  of  Danger’s comment would’ve been about  as  loud  as  someone  talking  in  a 13  normal speaking voice. It’s also noteworthy that Officer Navarro testified that a number of other people 14  (mostly protesters, it seems) were yelling and shouting in the same general area. It’s difficult to say exactly 15  how that would’ve impacted Officer Navarro’s hearing — to do that, I would have needed to conduct an 16  analysis  on-site, which I wasn’t able to do — but it’s safe to say that it  wouldn’t have made Danger’s 17  comment any clearer. All that in mind, it’s my expert opinion that, given the circumstances that Officer 18  Navarro describes in Officer Navarro’s affidavit, it would’ve been very difficult for Officer Navarro to 19  have heard Danger’s comment. After all, if you’re walking down the sidewalk with a friend and pass by 20  a jackhammer, what’s the likelihood that you’ll still be able to make out what your friend is saying? As 21  we all probably know from experience, not much. 22   Now, can I say with certainty whether Officer Navarro actually heard the comment? No, and it’s 23  possible that Officer Navarro did.

The training occurred on January 7, 18  2020. Officer Navarro was in that group and seemed actively engaged during our entire session. During the 19  training, I went over the full contents of RPD Directive 0635.10 in detail, went over the same points about 20  community policing that I make above, and discussed how that concept should influence the way in which 21  RPD  officers implement  the directive.  I  also  explained  that RPD  Directive  0635.10 was  an  official  RPD 22  policy  and  that  an  officer’s failure to abide by it could lead to official discipline. During  a  question  and 23  answer session toward the end of the training, I recall that Officer Navarro offered a comment and a question. 24  “You know,” Officer Navarro said, “we had a protest at the Digby last month, and some of the protesters 25  really got in our faces. What’s the best way to de-escalate that sort of verbal abuse?” Officer Navarro seemed 26  calm and genuine in asking the question. In response, I indicated that RPD officers should generally keep 27  their distance, except in cases where an officer perceives a threat of violence or property damage. Officer 28  Navarro nodded thoughtfully and indicated that Officer Navarro understood and appreciated my response. 29   In my expert opinion, Officer Navarro’s conduct during the January 15th protest complied with both 30  RPD Directive 0635.10 and more generally with the principles of community policing outlined above. By all 31  accounts, the crowd at the Digby was in an impassioned state, and Officer Navarro appropriately carried out 32  the advice I had given during our training session by politely asking them to move, rather than immediately 33       CLASSROOM LAW PROJECT                       2020 – 2021 Oregon High School Mock Trial Competition                       www.classroomlaw.org "},{"score":0.5272111892700195,"id":"441953592120826298","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826298","document_chunk_original":"        2020 – 2021 Oregon High School Mock Trial Competition                       www.classroomlaw.org  57  EXHIBIT 1: Photograph of rock found in Jersey Jackson’s hand             CLASSROOM LAW PROJECT                       2020 – 2021 Oregon High School Mock Trial Competition                       www.classroomlaw.org  59  EXHIBIT 2: Rowe Police Dept. Crowd Management/Control Policy    Rowe Police Department  Directive 0635.10  CROWD MANAGEMENT/CROWD CONTROL    Policy:  1. Purpose. The purpose of this Directive is to provide guidance for demonstrations, special  events, the managing of crowds during demonstrations, and controlling crowds during civil  disturbances.  2. Free Speech & Assembly. The Rowe Police Department recognizes that Rowe has a  tradition of free speech and assembly.  It is the responsibility and priority of the Rowe Police  Department not to unduly impede the exercise of First Amendment rights and to provide  for the safe and lawful expression of speech, while also maintaining the public safety, peace  and order.  A police response that impedes otherwise protected speech must be narrowly  tailored to serve a significant government interest. The content of the speech does not  provide the basis for imposing limitations on First Amendment rights. While the First  Amendment provides broad protections for the expression of speech, it does not provide  protection for criminal acts including, but not limited to, riot, disorder, interference with  traffic upon the public streets, or other immediate threats to public safety, peace or order.  3. Nature of Police Responses. The Rowe Police Department recognizes that  demonstrations and events are dynamic in nature.  Accordingly, Officers will monitor the  crowd throughout the event to assess the level of risk posed to both demonstrators and the  public at large, with the goal of minimizing potential violence, injury or damage to property.   Officers’ response should be commensurate to overall crowd behavior, and Officers should  differentiate between groups or individuals who are engaging in criminal behavior or  otherwise posing a threat to the safety of others and those in the crowd who are"},{"score":0.538963794708252,"id":"441953592120826254","document_chunk_id":"441953592120826254","document_chunk_original":" been to the Digby to see the Grateful Dead a few times in the 31  ‘80s, but I know that the theater has an even broader and more important place in Rowe’s civic history 32  and culture. “Well, what are we waiting for?” I asked Jersey. “Let’s head down there and give the theater 33  owner a piece of our minds!” Jersey told me that there was talk on social media of an organized protest 34       CLASSROOM LAW PROJECT                       2020 – 2021 Oregon High School Mock Trial Competition                       www.classroomlaw.org  30  that would occur the next day, on December 20th.

DIRECT OR CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE  There are two types of evidence. One is direct evidence — such as the testimony of an eyewitness.

You may base your verdict on direct evidence or on circumstantial evidence, or on both.  WITNESS FALSE IN PART  A witness who lies under oath in some part of his or her testimony is likely to lie in other parts of his or  her testimony. Therefore, if you find that a witness has lied in some part of his or her testimony, then you may  distrust the rest of that witness’s testimony.  Sometimes witnesses who are not lying may give incorrect testimony. They may forget matters or may  contradict themselves. Also, different witnesses may observe or remember an event differently. You have the  sole responsibility to determine what testimony, or portions of testimony, you will or will not rely on in  reaching your verdict.

After weighing all of the evidence, if you cannot decide that something is more likely true  than not true, you must conclude that the plaintiff did not prove it. You should consider all of the evidence in  making that determination, no matter who produced it.  RETALIATORY ARREST IN VIOLATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT  Under the First Amendment, a citizen has the right to free expression. In order to prove the defendant  deprived the plaintiff of this First Amendment right, the plaintiff must prove the following elements by a  preponderance of the evidence: (1) the plaintiff engaged in speech protected under the First Amendment; (2) the  defendant took action against the plaintiff; and (3) the plaintiff’s protected speech was a substantial or  motivating factor for the defendant’s action. A substantial or motivating factor is a significant factor.  In this case, the plaintiff contends that the unlawful action taken against the plaintiff by the defendant  was an arrest. Accordingly, the plaintiff must also prove (4) that the arrest occurred without probable cause, or  that other similarly situated individuals who were not engaged in the same sort of protected speech were not  arrested.

The Digby would live to see another day. 3  I had forgotten all about that first protest when the Department got another call from Camden in 4  early January. (Again, I fielded that call.) According to Camden, it was basically the same deal as before: 5  the demolition had been rescheduled, social media was buzzing about a protest, and there were rumors 6  that  some  of  the  protesters  were  going  physically block  the  demolition  from  happening.  My  sergeant 7  dispatched the same group that had responded to the last protest, along with a few additional officers for 8  backup. We were instructed to put on our RPD protective gear (helmets, protective vests, knee and elbow 9  pads, etc.) to ensure our safety, but that wasn’t my decision. Had it been up to me, I would’ve focused 10  instead to trying to deescalate things. Our protective gear, which can make us look a little ominous, often 11  has the opposite effect. 12  We arrived at the Digby on the morning of the protest to find that a group of demonstrators had 13  positioned themselves against the chain-link fence that surrounded the theater. I found that a bit worrisome 14  — they’d eventually have to move — but, because they weren’t doing anything wrong, we let them be for 15  the moment. At 1000 hours, though (when the demolition was scheduled to begin), the demolition crew 16  powered up its equipment, and the protesters by the fence began yelling at them.
