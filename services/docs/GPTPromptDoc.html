  <h1>MOTION TO DISMISS</h1>
  <p> COMES NOW, the Defendant, Marlowe Navarro, by and through counsel, and moves this Court for an Order dismissing
    Plaintiff's Complaint pursuant to the Oregon Rules of Civil Procedure, and in support thereof, states as follows:
  </p>
  <h2>I. Background</h2>
  <p> Plaintiff, Jersey Jackson, alleges that Defendant, Marlowe Navarro, an officer of the Rowe Police Department,
    wrongfully arrested him during a demonstration in downtown Rowe and that such arrest was in violation of his First
    Amendment rights. At the time of the arrest, different parties were involved, including Camden Buchanen, a witness;
    \"Danger\" Smith, another protester; and Trinni Redbird, an expert witness who provided a signed affidavit. </p>
  <h2>II. Argument</h2>
  <p> Defendant, Marlowe Navarro, moves this Court to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint on the following grounds: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p> Plaintiff's Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> Plaintiff's Complaint lacks sufficient specificity to put the Defendant on notice of the claims against him.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p> The arrest of the Plaintiff was based on probable cause, and therefore, Defendant is entitled to qualified
        immunity. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>III. Conclusion</h2>
  <p> For the reasons stated above, Defendant, Marlowe Navarro, respectfully requests that this Court grant his Motion
    to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint with prejudice. </p>
