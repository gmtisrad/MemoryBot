  <h1>MOTION TO DISMISS</h1>
  <p> Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Defendant Marlowe Novarro (\"Mr. Novarro\")
    respectfully moves this Court for an order dismissing the claims against him in the above-captioned case in their
    entirety and with prejudice. </p>
  <h2>MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO DISMISS</h2>
  <p> This action arises is an alleged violation of Plaintiff Jersey Jackson (\"Mr. Jackson\")'s First Amendment Rights.
    Mr. Novarro, an officer of the Rowe Police Department, is entitled to qualified immunities because they as a law
    enforcement officer, acting within the scope of his duties during the relevant incidents, and there are no
    allegations to overcome this defense. </p>
  <p> According to the affidavits submitted by the parties, including Mr. Buchanan, Smith, Saab, Jackson, and Mr.
    Novarro himself, as well as the Rowe Police Department's Crowd Control Policy (Exhibit 2), Mr. Novarro was following
    guidelines and procedures set forth by the department. Mr. Novarro differentiated between individuals engaged in
    criminal behavior and those lawfully demonstrating, as required by the policy. </p>
  <p> Furthermore, Mr. Novarro took the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of other individuals by asking
    demonstrators to disperse twice before making any arrests. This action is in accordance with the specific procedures
    outlined in the Crowd Control Policy (Exhibit 2). </p>
  <p> To surpass the defense of qualified immunity, Mr. Jackson must establish that Mr. Novarro violated clearly
    established statutory or constitutional rights, of which a reasonable person would have known. Here, Mr. Jackson has
    failed to allege facts to support such a violation or that a reasonable officer in Mr. Novarro's position would have
    known of it. </p>
  <p> As such, all claims against Mr. Novarro should be dismissed based on qualified immunity. </p>
