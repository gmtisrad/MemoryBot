      <h2>COUNTER-COMPLAINT</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Marlowe Navarro ("Navarro"), the defendant in the above-entitled action,
        hereby asserts and files this Counter-Complaint against the plaintiff,
        Jersey Jackson ("Jackson"), for a frivolous claim brought against
        Navarro. Navarro seeks damages for the injury to Navarro's reputation,
        mental anguish, cost and stress of defending against the frivolous
        claim, and other relief.
      </p>
      <h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <p>
        1. This action arises from a frivolous claim made by Jackson against
        Navarro, alleging that Navarro violated Jackson's constitutional rights
        during an incident on January 15, 2020. The plaintiff's allegations are
        false, malicious, and made with reckless disregard for the truth.
        Navarro seeks compensation for the harm caused to Navarro's reputation,
        mental anguish, the cost and stress of defending against the frivolous
        claim, as well as punitive damages.
      </p>
      <h2>II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE</h2>
      <p>
        2. This Court has jurisdiction over this counter-complaint by virtue of
        28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343, as the case involves allegations of abuse of
        process and malicious prosecution.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, i.e.,
        because the events giving rise to Navarro's counter-claims against
        Jackson occurred in the judicial district in which this Court is
        situated.
      </p>
      <h2>III. PARTIES</h2>
      <p>
        4. Navarro is an individual employed as a police officer by Rowe Police
        Department ("RPD") and a resident of Rowe, Oregon.
      </p>
      <p>5. Jackson is an individual who resides in Rowe, Oregon.</p>
      <h2>IV. FACTS</h2>
      <p>
        6. On January 15, 2020, Navarro was lawfully executing Navarro's duties
        as a police officer for RPD during a demonstration in downtown Rowe.
        Navarro, acting in good faith and under color of law, reasonably
        believed that Jackson was engaged in illegal conduct and arrested
        Jackson accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        7. Jackson filed a complaint against Navarro, alleging unlawful arrest
        in violation of Jackson's constitutional rights. Jackson's claim is
        frivolous and without merit, as it is based on false allegations and a
        reckless disregard for the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        8. As a result of Jackson's frivolous claim against Navarro, Navarro
        suffered damages, including injury to Navarro's reputation, mental
        anguish, and the cost and stress of defending against the frivolous
        claim.
      </p>
      <h2>V. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF</h2>
      <p><b>First Claim for Relief: Abuse of Process</b></p>
      <p>
        9. Navarro incorporates and realleges each of the preceding paragraphs
        as if fully set forth herein.
      </p>
      <p>
        10. Jackson's use of the legal process in filing the claim against
        Navarro was improper, made for ulterior purposes, and was not a
        legitimate attempt to seek redress for a valid claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        11. As a result of the abuse of process, Navarro has suffered damages,
        as described above.
      </p>
      <p><b>Second Claim for Relief: Malicious Prosecution</b></p>
      <p>
        12. Navarro incorporates and realleges each of the preceding paragraphs
        as if fully set forth herein.
      </p>
      <p>
        13. Jackson initiated the claim against Navarro with malice and without
        probable cause, as evidenced by their frivolous and false allegations
        against Navarro.
      </p>
      <p>
        14. As a result of the malicious prosecution, Navarro has suffered
        damages, as described above.
      </p>
      <h2>VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF</h2>
      <p>WHEREFORE, Navarro prays for relief as follows:</p>
      <p>
        a) An award of compensatory damages against Jackson in an amount to be
        determined at trial for the injury to Navarro's reputation, mental
        anguish, and the cost and stress of defending against the frivolous
        claim;
      </p>
      <p>
        b) An award of punitive damages against Jackson in an amount to be
        determined at trial;
      </p>
      <p>
        c) An award of the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs that Navarro
        incurs in bringing this counter-complaint; and
      </p>
      <p>d) Such other relief as may be just and proper.</p>
